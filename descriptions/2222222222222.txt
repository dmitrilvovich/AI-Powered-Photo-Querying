"The image shows a page from a notebook with a math problem and its detailed solution. The work is written in blue ink on lined paper. The lines are college-ruled with margins. There is a hole punched on the right side of the page. The content is handwritten and neatly organized, and every step in the math problem is clearly shown. Here is a detailed description of the content:\n\n1. **Heading**:\n   - At the top left corner, it starts with `Q3`, indicating this is the third question or problem on the page.\n\n2. **Initial Equations**:\n   - The work begins by establishing two expressions for \\( f(x + h) \\) and \\( f(x - h) \\) using Taylor series expansions:\n\n     \\[ f(x + h) = f(x) + hf'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2}f''(x) + \\frac{h^3}{6}f'''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{24}f^{(4)}(z_1) \\]\n   \n     \\[ f(x - h) = f(x) - hf'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2}f''(x) - \\frac{h^3}{6}f'''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{24}f^{(4)}(z_2) \\]\n\n     - It is indicated that \\( z_1 \\in [x, x+h] \\) and \\( z_2 \\in [x-h, x] \\).\n\n3. **Main Derivation**:\n   - The next section derives the expression for \\( f''(x) \\):\n\n     \\[ \\therefore f(x - h) - 2f(x) + f(x + h) = \\]\n\n     \\[ -f''(x) = \\]\n\n     \\[ \\frac{h^2}{2}f''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{24}(f^{(4)}(z_1) + f^{(4)}(z_2)) \\]\n\n     - The terms are algebraically simplified, and necessary transformations involving \\( h \\) and \\( f''(x) \\), as well as higher-order derivatives, are shown.\n\n4. **Simplification and Conclusion**:\n   - The steps move forward to isolate \\( f''(x) \\)"
