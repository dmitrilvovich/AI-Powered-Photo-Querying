"The image portrays a joyful wedding scene. In the center are the bride and groom, both smiling broadly. The bride is in a white lace strapless gown, holding a bouquet of white roses and greenery. She has her hair styled elegantly and wears minimal jewelry. The groom is dressed in a sharp blue suit with a white dress shirt and blue tie, accessorized with a boutonni\u00e8re. Surrounding the couple are friends and family, clapping and cheering. The guests display a mix of elegant attire, some in suits and others in dresses. The setting appears to be outdoors, with blurred green trees and sunlit foliage in the background, contributing to a bright and lively atmosphere."
